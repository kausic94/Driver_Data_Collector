<center><h1> Driver Data Collector </h1></center>

---

In my final year of my undergraduation some of my computer science friends approached me to help them with their electronics. I do not exactly recollect the details of their project. To give a vague overview, their project involved collecting the driving behavior data. The data includes distance the driver maintains from the other vehicles and objects in the vicinity of the car, the intensity of the breaking as well as the driver;s heartbeat. They then ran a random forest algorithm on the data and infered something which I am not aware of. Anyway, they were busy with the implementation of the algorithm and so they wanted me to take care of the electronics in exchange for some Chicken Tikka and Naan. Seemed like a good deal and I took it. 

So this is an arduino project which takes the readings of three sensors. A flex sensor that measures the intensity of the reading, two ultrasonic sensors that measure the proximity and finally a heartbeat sensor. The ultrasonic sensors were mounted on a servo, so that they could sweep across their mount point to cover maximum area. 

This has been implemented in the functions and this is straightforward. 


I did this project as a favor for one of my friend. He was in the computer science department and needed help in the hardware part. The project was fairly simple and took me around 2 hours to finish it. The project involved the interfacing of a flex sensor, an ultrasonic sensor and a servo. 

Hope you find the code useful.
