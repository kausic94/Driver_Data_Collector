# Project For Sai

I did this project as a favor for one of my friend. He was in the computer science department and needed help in the hardware part. The project was fairly simple and took me around 2 hours to finish it. The project involved the interfacing of a flex sensor, an ultrasonic sensor and a servo. 

Hope you find the code useful.
